    </center>
    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
        There was a dog that was very hungry. He searched for food everywhere and at last he found a bone. He picked the
        bone with his mouth and started going back to his home. There was a bridge on the way to his home. <br>
        When he started crossing it he saw his reflection in the water. The dog thought that there was another dog with
        a bone in water. He wanted to get that other bone too. <br>
        So he started barking at his own reflection. His bone fell in water as soon as he opened his mouth. The greedy
        dog lost his bone. <br>
      <b>  Moral of the Story:</b> Donâ€™t be greedy."
