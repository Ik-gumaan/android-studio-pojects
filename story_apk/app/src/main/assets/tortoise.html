        "Once, a hare saw a tortoise walking slowly with a heavy shell on his back. The hare was very proud of himself
        and he asked the tortoise. Shall we have a race? <br>
        The tortoise agreed. They started the running race. The hare ran very fast. But the tortoise walked very
        slowly. The proud hair rested under a tree and soon slept off. But the tortoise walked very fast, slowly and
        steadily and reached the goal. At last, the tortoise won the race. <br>
        <b> Moral:</b> Pride goes before a fall.
