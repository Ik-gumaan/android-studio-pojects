        "One day, a crow stole a piece of meat. She flew away and sat on the branch of a tree. At that moment , a fox
        going somewhere. When he came under that tree, he noticed the meat in the crow’s beak. The sight of the piece of
        meat made his mouth filled with water. He thought for sometimes. <br>
        Then he hit upon a plan to have it. He said to the crow, “Oh beautiful Crow! Your complexion is so fair. I think
        you can sing nicely. Would you please sing a song for me?” At first the crow did not want to sing. But as the
        fox carried on praising her, she felt proud of her tongue.<br>
        Finally, she started to sing a song. But no sooner had she opened her mouth than the piece of meat fell off her
        mouth. The clever fox took it and ran away. The crow had paid a heavy price for her foolishness.<br>
       <b> Moral:</b> Don’t fool other, Otherwise you will be fooled."
