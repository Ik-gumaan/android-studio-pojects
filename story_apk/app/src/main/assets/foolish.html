    </center>
    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">"Once a stag was drinking water at a pond. He saw his reflection in its clean water. He looked at his beautiful
        horns and admired them. He also saw his thin and lean legs. He disliked them. Just then he saw some hounds
        coming toward him. He ran as fast as his legs carried him far away. <br>
         He rushed into a forest. His beautiful horns
        were caught in a bush. He tried hard to free himself but in vain. Soon the hounds reached the spot and tore him
        into pieces. <br>
      <b>Moral:</b> All that glitters is not gold."</p>
