    </center>
    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
        Once there lived a poor woodcutter. He used to cut trees in the woods. One day he was cutting wood on the bank
        of a river. His axe fell down into the river. The river was deep. He could not take his axe out. He sat on the
        bank and began to weep. <br>
        Mercury, the god of water appeared. He asked the reason of his weeping. The woodcutter told the whole story.
        Mercury dived into the water and brought a golden axe. The woodcutter refused to take it. Mercury again dived
        and brought a silver axe. <br>
         The woodcutter did not take it either. Then he brought an iron axe. The woodcutter
        took it gladly. Mercury was much pleased. He rewarded the woodcutter with the other two axes. <br>
        <b> Moral:</b> Honesty is the best policy."
