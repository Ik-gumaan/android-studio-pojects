    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
        One hot day in summer. The crow was very thirsty. He was looking for some water to drink. The crow flew here and
        there in search of water, but he could not find any in the neighborhood. At last, he saw a jar on the roof of a
        house. The crow happily flew to the jar. <br>
        He saw into it and found a minimal amount of water in a jar. He tried his best to drink water but could not
        succeed because the water was shallow. His beak could not reach it. Crow felt disappointed, but he did not lose
        his heart. All of a sudden, He thought an idea. He saw a heap of stones at some distance. He started bringing
        stones one by one and dropping them into the jar. <br>
        After some time, the water inside the jar began to rise. Crow drink water to his fill and flew away happily. <br>
