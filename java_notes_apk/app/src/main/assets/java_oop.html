<h3>OOP</h3>
<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
	<br><br>
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
	<br><br>
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
	<br><br>
OOP is faster and easier to execute<br>
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs<br>
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY &quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot;, and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
	<br>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</p>
